# My Portfolio

# Description
This repository is my first ever attempt at creating a portfolio. It is currently and will always be a work in progress.

# Goal
The intention is to display the history of my work with regards to web development in a simple and easily accessible format.

# Usage
The navigation bar at the top will take you to the section you selected within the same webpage. The boxes are intended to be images of my work in the future with labels that will take you to the selected repository.
